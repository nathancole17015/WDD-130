        [Over the past several semesters I have taken coding classes to pursue a career in computer science. I have taken introduction to programming, programming with functions, and JavaScript. People will come to my site to see work that I have completed. This meant for future employers and recruiters. I want a place to display work that I have done to show off my skills. I hope that the future employers would appreciate a place that they can go to see a collection of programs I have made. 


        Visitors will come to my site over others because it will display information on me. This site is totally just to display information on me. It will also have contact information if anyone would have questions, I will display my email address. On the home page it has a picture of me and the mission for the website. I look forward to place that employers can come see work that I have accomplished. I can also have this website for future projects I complete. I can also display other things that I have created. Some things that could be displayed are pictures I have taken. And other art that I have created. 
        There are several questions that can be answered through this website. One question that can be answered is information about me. Reasons why an employer would hire me. There will be no activities for the people to visit my site. But they will be able to look at my programs I created. I look forward to have location where I can display the work I have completed so far. I know this website will make a part of my life more convenient

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        [For a couple of these classes I had to come up with my own programs. I would like to exhibit those programs on a webpage. For page 2 I would like to display the program I made in my programing with functions class. It’s meant for converting measurements from metric to imperial and imperial to metric. The program displays different options to choose. The options are different kinds of measurements. Its starts with a measurement with liquids, measurements, weight, and temperature. This program won’t actually run on the site. It will just show the code that I created. Then anyone can copy and paste it to VS Code to run the program. I would have a title on the page of the program. I will also have a short description of what it does. I going to put a couple of pictures on the page. A image of measuring devices such as a yard stick , measuring cups, and a scale. I think this will be good display of my skills.]

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        [Page number three will be a program I created in in JavaScript class this semester. I created a website that displays the biography of a Pokémon. It retrieves data from another website on a chosen Pokémon. There’s a search option where you will type a Pokémon name then the program returns information. The information returned in the moves set, strengths and weaknesses, what type of Pokémon it is. Right now, the program just has a title and a text box until someone enters a name. I will add more images to the page and some CSS. This page will display my skill in JavaScript. The person visiting this site will actually be able to interact with it. They can enter any name of a Pokémon and the information will pop up. This page will be a little more fun than the other page. More user interaction than the other pages. ]
